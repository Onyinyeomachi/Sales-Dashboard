# Business Overview
Nova Retail Solutions operates within the retail segment and is involved in a wide variety of products, from furniture and office supplies to technology.

The customers who take the service vary from consumers and corporate clients to small businesses across different regions. The company would wish to continue using data-driven insights to drive performance improvement, profitability enhancement, and customer satisfaction as competition stiffens.


# Justification for the Project 
The rationale for the project is to create an extensive dashboard using excel, which visually communicates the performance of Nova Retail Solutions.

Through the examination of sales trends, profitability by region, shipping modes, and product categories, the dashboard will display fundamental information that can be used for better decision-making. This will, in turn, help improve shipping processes, show which regions and lines of products have better performance, and point out those needing improvement, thus supporting long-term growth objectives of the company.



# PROBLEM STATEMENT 
Nova Retail Solutions is confronted with the following problems in understanding key drivers of sales and profitability: a better understanding of regional sales, the relative effectiveness of its various shipping modes, and which product categories contribute most to profitability. The lack of such information makes it difficult for decision-makers to know which areas to invest resources in, for instance, or how to adjust pricing or improve customer service. In this case, no real centralized dashboard of key performance indicators has been put together for effective decision-making.


# Objective of the Project 
The objective of this project is to develop an interactive Dashboard that can provide Nova Retail Solutions with key business insights into the analysis on:

Sales Trend
Profit and Sales across different Region
Shipping performance
Product profitability and Sales.

KPIs such as:

Total sales
Total profit
The total number of orders
Profit margins (total Profit/total sales)


# Data Sources
The dataset used in this project was provided by 10Alytics.
